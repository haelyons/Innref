To-do:
1. Read TOC and create key-value pairs
2. Fetch url from TOC data-structure (equivalent of structs in python?)
3. WIP: Extract text from limited body (only chapter content)

Research:
A. Python data-structures - equivalent to C structs, or best practice
B. Database creation for saving information, or alternatives for speed and weight
C. NLP to programatically sort names, places, classes, skills and attributes
