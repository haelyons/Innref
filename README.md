  ## Background
The Wandering Inn (TWI) is "A tale of a girl, an inn, and a world full of levels" -- a web serial written by Pirateaba since ~2015. The story is set in a fantasy world loosely inspired by DnD style character progression, and characters have Classes with Skills and levels.

The levels, Skills, and Classes in which people gain them are presented in the text with square brackets [], and are assigned based on the characters' decisions, path in life, and perspective on themselves -- think DnD, but without NPCs! 

As you can imagine, Classes and Skills are not gimmicks, but rather fundamental rules of 'Innworld' which serve as plot and character devices. Pivotal Class and Skill changes most often come at points that are also pivotal for character development.

The idea for this tool comes from a combination of these markers, and the current length of the serial - 9.3 million words. Using the easy references provided by Skills and Classes, we can pinpoint the moments we want for re-reads based on Class and Skill references, and provide a quick tool for Wiki contributors to reference the text.


  ## Goal
Build a web interface with a stats page and search engine that provide:
- Live stats on the total word count, the avg. count per chapter, the number of chapters, etc
- The ability to track chapter references to Classes and Skills using a search bar

(Hopefully)
- The ability to link Class and Skill references to specific characters
