  ## Background
The Wandering Inn is "A tale of a girl, an inn, and a world full of levels." The levels, and classes in which people gain them, are presented with brackets and are 
assigned based on the characters' decisions, path in life, and perspective on themselves. Skills, both active and passive (assigned based on Class) are also 
denoted with square brackets. In addition this story is as of 12/08/22 the longest series in the English language at a whopping 9.3 million words.

As you can imagine, Classes and Skills are not gimmicks, but rather fundamental rules of 'Innworld' which serve as plot and character devices. Pivotal class and skill 
changes most often come at points that are also pivotal for character and plot development. Enter: Innref (or potentially WanderingStat, I'm split).
